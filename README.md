Software does not have problems.

People have problems.

Software does not solve problems.

People solve problems.

Relationships connect people to problems.

Without relationships, we face our problems alone.

Adoption is use of software, not a relationship with a person.

But software create relationships between people with common problems, so they can solve them together.
