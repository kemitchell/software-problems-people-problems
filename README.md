Software does not have problems.

People have problems.

Software does not solve problems.

People solve problems.

Relationships connect people to problems.

Without relationships, we face our problems alone.

Adoption is a relationship with a piece software, not a person.

But the purpose of software is to create relationships between people with common needs, so they can solve their problems together.
