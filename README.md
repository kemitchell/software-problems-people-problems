Software does not have problems.

People have problems.

Software does not solve problems.

People solve problems.

Relationships connect people to problems.

Without relationships, we face our problems alone.

Use is a relationship to software, not with people.

The purpose of software is to create relationships between people, so they can solve their problems together.
